# SearchMart
SearchEngine for scraped pages from walmart.com

Contains the webscraper used to scrape data from walmart.com and the scraped dataset. Each '_products.txt' file contains unique products in that category and the '_links.txt' file holds the links between different products.

To run the web scraper, you need to provide three command-line arguments: the url where it should start scraping, the max number of products it should crawl to, and the name of the department you are scraping.
